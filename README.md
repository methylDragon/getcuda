## Welcome!

The star of our show:

```
curl getcuda.ml/ubuntu.sh | sudo bash
```

The only thing that might not actually be installed by default on Ubuntu is `curl`. Please make sure that is installed!

**Note: you really shouldn't `curl` and run scripts as root without inspecting its contents!**

## Others

* `curl getcuda.ml/arm/opencv.sh | sudo bash`
* `curl getcuda.ml/arm/opencv-pizero.sh | sudo bash`
